# MC race forecaster

Summary: jupyter notebook (python 3) showcasing methods including: data cleaning in pandas, linear regression (including bootstrapping), Monte-Carlo simulations, pandas data handling, data visulisations and comparison analysis. 

Full overview: Running clubs in the Greater Southampton area annually compete in the 'Mile of Miles' team competition, typically held in June. Given the cancellation of events in 2020, my club decided to replicate it with our own, virtual event. In this virtual Mile of Miles race, there are 12 teams of 10 runners, drawn randomly from a hat beforehand. Each team member completes the fastest 1 mile time they can, at any time, on any net zero elevation route in a set week. The team's time is the summation of the each team member's 1 mile time. Every second counts!

I here build a simple statistical model to simulate the event using data-driven statistics. I completed this in 3 days in June, 2020, in between doing my PhD in Astrophysics at Univeristy of Southampton. I step through each stage of the methodology and discuss the successes and limitations of such an approach -- as well as how to improve upon it.
